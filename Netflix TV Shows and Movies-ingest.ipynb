The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a \"Qadiani\"-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious.</td>\n            <td>2018</td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>75</td>\n            <td>tt7904606</td>\n            <td>7.8</td>\n            <td>414.0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2958</td>\n            <td>tm367613</td>\n            <td>Mr. Chandramouli</td>\n            <td>MOVIE</td>\n            <td>Raghav, a professional boxer, finds himself in a fix when an unexpected turn of events gets him tangled in a battle between his passion, family and the love of his life.</td>\n            <td>2018</td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>122</td>\n            <td>tt7486356</td>\n            <td>5.1</td>\n            <td>234.0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2974</td>\n            <td>tm325650</td>\n            <td>King of Peking</td>\n            <td>MOVIE</td>\n            <td>When home entertainment enters the market in 90s Beijing, a former projectionist ropes his young son into starting their own pirate movie company, but easy money comes with its own price tag.</td>\n            <td>2017</td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>88</td>\n            <td>tt6406976</td>\n            <td>6.4</td>\n            <td>364.0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>3364</td>\n            <td>tm822907</td>\n            <td>Patsy & Loretta</td>\n            <td>MOVIE</td>\n            <td>A story of the close friendship of country music stars Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn.</td>\n            <td>2019</td>\n            <td></td>\n            <td>88</td>\n            <td>tt10016704</td>\n            <td>6.8</td>\n            <td>1000.0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>3426</td>\n            <td>tm461366</td>\n            <td>The Coldest Game</td>\n            <td>MOVIE</td>\n            <td>Warsaw, Poland, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962.

The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a \"Qadiani\"-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious. |     2018     |                   |    75   | tt7904606  |        7.8

Alice's life begins to change when she meets Tio, an actor on the network's flagship soap opera and self-professed astrological guru, who will soon become her personal \"astrological guide for broken hearts\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     2021     |       TV-14       |    34   | tt14759406 |        7.1        |   2827.0   |\n|  4769 |  tm888243 |                        Pray Away                        | MOVIE |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In the 1970s, five men struggling with being gay in their Evangelical church started a bible study to help each other leave the \"homosexual lifestyle.\" They quickly received over 25,000 letters from people asking for help and formalized as Exodus International, the largest and most controversial conversion therapy organization in the world. But leaders struggled with a secret: their own â€œsame-sex attractionsâ€ never went away. After years as Christian superstars in the religious right, many of these men and women have come out as LGBTQ, disavowing the very movement they helped start. Focusing on the dramatic journeys of former conversion therapy leaders, current members, and a survivor, PRAY AWAY chronicles the â€œex gay\" movementâ€™s rise to power, persistent influence, and the profound harm it causes.

the larger-than-life Polaroid Land 20x24 camera.

Tracing the web of power, money, violence and politics, the film masterfully portrays the dark sides of globalisation and not least an Austrian tale of willful ignorance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     2018     |                   |    90   | tt7683350  |        4.8        |   162.0    |\n|  2808 |  tm434126 |                Rafinha Bastos: Ultimatum                | MOVIE |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        An off-color joke nearly cost him everything.

that contains several variables (columns) so you can visualize the correlation or relationship between them. A common use for a heatmap in a dataset like yours (IMDb data) is to visualize the correlation between different numeric features such as imdb_score, runtime, release_year, and any other numerical columns you might have. Here's a generic example of how you can create a heatmap using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.
